# Google Play Store Data Analysis with PySpark

Welcome to the **Google Play Store Data Analysis** project! This project leverages **PySpark** for large-scale data processing and analysis of app-related data from the Google Play Store.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze trends, ratings, reviews, and other key insights from the Google Play Store dataset. By using **PySpark**, we efficiently process large datasets, clean data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is included in the repository, so no external downloads are required.

## Key Features

This project includes:
- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Handling missing values, type conversion, and data transformation using PySpark DataFrames.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding trends, distributions, and correlations between different features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables, handling categorical data, and scaling numerical data for modeling.

## Tools and Technologies

The following technologies and platforms were used in this project:

- **PySpark**: Used for distributed data processing and analysis.
- **Databricks**: The cloud-based platform used for running PySpark.
- **Python**: The primary programming language.

## Usage

To explore and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/ajith-ks/google-playstore-analysis.git
   

2. Open **Databricks** and upload the notebook `Google Playstore.ipynb` along with the dataset.

3. Run the notebook cells in Databricks to execute the data analysis pipeline.

## Insights and Findings

Some key insights extracted from the dataset:

- **Category Trends:** Certain categories like `Game` and `Tools` have the highest number of apps.
- **Ratings Distribution:** Most apps have ratings between **4.0 and 4.5**, while very few have a perfect 5-star rating.
- **Free vs Paid Apps:** The majority of apps are free, but paid apps tend to have slightly higher ratings.
- **Installs & Success Factors:** Apps with more installs generally have better ratings and more reviews.
